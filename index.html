        <p class="intro">"See the positive things in the process, don't get disappointed from how long it takes, in the end small steps lead to the greatest results." This is a quote that I live by and try my best to follow every day, especially during my journey as a new Software Engineering student. It reminds us that even though we do not see any big changes or results right away, doesn't mean that we are not improving every day.</p>
        <p class="intro">I'm glad that you have reached my page and I hope you enjoy my first personal website project.</p>
